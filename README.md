# ARTH: Decentralized Borrowing Protocol

ARTH is a stablecoin that is designed to appreciate overtime against the US dollar while at the same time remain relatively stable.

ARTH is minted/burnt using decentralized smart contracts that use ETH as collateral to maintain its peg. The interest rate charged to mint ARTH using ETH is 0%, which makes it very cost effective for borrowing/lending.

ARTH is fully collateralized with mechanisms that give it a backing of at least 110% in ETH.
