## PopulatedRedemption interface

A redemption transaction that has been prepared for sending.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PopulatedRedemption<P = unknown, S = unknown, R = unknown> extends PopulatedLiquityTransaction<P, SentLiquityTransaction<S, LiquityReceipt<R, RedemptionDetails>>> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [PopulatedLiquityTransaction](./arth-base.populatedliquitytransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;P, [SentLiquityTransaction](./arth-base.sentliquitytransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;S, [LiquityReceipt](./arth-base.liquityreceipt.md)<!-- -->&lt;R, [RedemptionDetails](./arth-base.redemptiondetails.md)<!-- -->&gt;&gt;&gt;

## Remarks

The Liquity protocol fulfills redemptions by repaying the debt of Troves in ascending order of their collateralization ratio, and taking a portion of their collateral in exchange. Due to the [minimum debt](./arth-base.arth_minimum_debt.md) requirement that Troves must fulfill, some ARTH amounts are not possible to redeem exactly.

When [redeemARTH()](./arth-base.populatableliquity.redeemarth.md) is called with an amount that can't be fully redeemed, the amount will be truncated (see the `redeemableARTHAmount` property). When this happens, the redeemer can either redeem the truncated amount by sending the transaction unchanged, or prepare a new transaction by [increasing the amount](./arth-base.populatedredemption.increaseamountbyminimumnetdebt.md) to the next lowest possible value, which is the sum of the truncated amount and [ARTH\_MINIMUM\_NET\_DEBT](./arth-base.arth_minimum_net_debt.md)<!-- -->.
