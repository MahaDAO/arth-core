## UserTrove class

A Trove that is associated with a single owner.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class UserTrove extends Trove 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [Trove](./arth-base.trove.md)

## Remarks

The SDK uses the base [Trove](./arth-base.trove.md) class as a generic container of collateral and debt, for example to represent the [total collateral and debt](./arth-base.readableliquity.gettotal.md) locked up in the protocol.

The `UserTrove` class extends `Trove` with extra information that's only available for Troves that are associated with a single owner (such as the owner's address, or the Trove's status).

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `UserTrove` class.
