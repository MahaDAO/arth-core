## PopulatedEthersRedemption class

A redemption transaction that has been prepared for sending.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class PopulatedEthersRedemption extends PopulatedEthersARTHTransaction<RedemptionDetails> implements PopulatedRedemption<EthersPopulatedTransaction, EthersTransactionResponse, EthersTransactionReceipt> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [PopulatedEthersARTHTransaction](./arth-ethers.populatedethersarthtransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;[RedemptionDetails](./arth-base.redemptiondetails.md)<!-- -->&gt;

<b>Implements:</b> [PopulatedRedemption](./arth-base.populatedredemption.md)<!-- -->&lt;[EthersPopulatedTransaction](./arth-ethers.etherspopulatedtransaction.md)<!-- -->, [EthersTransactionResponse](./arth-ethers.etherstransactionresponse.md)<!-- -->, [EthersTransactionReceipt](./arth-ethers.etherstransactionreceipt.md)<!-- -->&gt;

## Remarks

The Liquity protocol fulfills redemptions by repaying the debt of Troves in ascending order of their collateralization ratio, and taking a portion of their collateral in exchange. Due to the [minimum debt](./arth-base.arth_minimum_debt.md) requirement that Troves must fulfill, some ARTH amounts are not possible to redeem exactly.

When [redeemARTH()](./arth-base.populatableliquity.redeemarth.md) is called with an amount that can't be fully redeemed, the amount will be truncated (see the `redeemableARTHAmount` property). When this happens, the redeemer can either redeem the truncated amount by sending the transaction unchanged, or prepare a new transaction by [increasing the amount](./arth-base.populatedredemption.increaseamountbyminimumnetdebt.md) to the next lowest possible value, which is the sum of the truncated amount and [ARTH\_MINIMUM\_NET\_DEBT](./arth-base.arth_minimum_net_debt.md)<!-- -->.
